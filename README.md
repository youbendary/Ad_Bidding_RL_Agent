# Ad Bidding Reinforcement Learning Agents 


## DQN Agent
To reproduce the result in the [report](report.pdf) (cumulative average win rate being over 50% at the end of training), please clone the repository and run the following command in the terminal under the DQN_Agent folder: 

`python MultiTaskAgent.py --num_episodes 10000`
